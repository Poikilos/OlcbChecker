    \section{Introduction}

    This note documents the procedure for checking an OpenLCB implementation against the 
    \href{#1}
    {#2}.

    The checks are traceable to specific sections of the Standard.

    The checking assumes that the Device Being Checked (DBC) is being exercised by other
    nodes on the message network, 
    e.g. is responding to enquiries from other parts of the message network.
